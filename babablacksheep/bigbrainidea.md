one bright and sunny morning, xiao ming went to the supermarket.
he bought three fish, and a chicken.
he lugged the red plastic bag all the way home, oblivious to what was lying ahead of him.
he fished about his pockets to find a bunch of metal keys, jingled them and smirked ://.
he stopped in front of a door with a sinister smile. Unlocking it, his eyes fell onto his victim, his step-brother, John. 
his hands went back to his pocket where a small dagger was placed, playing around with it, as if he could not wait to use it.
